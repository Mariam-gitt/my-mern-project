   Extract hard vocabulary words from any text-based PDF.

   Algorithm:
    1. Parse PDF text with pdf-parse
    2. Tokenise into all words ≥ 4 chars, count frequencies
    3. Build EASY_WORDS set — skip the ~1 000 most common English words
    4. Score remaining words by:
         • Length                 (longer = harder)
         • Academic suffix match  (-tion, -ity, -ology …)
         • Academic prefix match  (inter-, micro-, pseudo- …)
         • Rarity in this doc     (appears only 1-2 times = less familiar)
    5. Exclude words already in the user's vocab
    6. Return top 50, sorted score-desc, with PDF meta-stats
